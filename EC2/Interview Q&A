1. What is Amazon EC2?
Answer: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. It allows users to run virtual servers (instances) in the cloud with varying configurations of CPU, memory, and storage.

2. What are the different types of EC2 instances?
Answer: EC2 instances are categorized into different types based on the compute, memory, and storage they provide:
General Purpose (e.g., t2, t3, m5): Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
Compute Optimized (e.g., c5, c6g): Ideal for compute-intensive applications.
Memory Optimized (e.g., r5, x1): Optimized for memory-intensive applications.
Storage Optimized (e.g., i3, d2): Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets.
Accelerated Computing (e.g., p3, g4): Uses GPUs for tasks like machine learning and graphic rendering.

3. What is the difference between EC2 and a traditional server?
Answer: EC2 instances are virtual machines that can be dynamically resized, created, or terminated as per demand. Traditional servers are physical machines and usually more rigid, require manual scaling, and have higher upfront costs.

4. What are EC2 pricing models?
Answer:
On-Demand Instances: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments.
Reserved Instances (RIs): Offers savings up to 75% over On-Demand pricing in exchange for committing to a usage plan (1-year or 3-year).
Spot Instances: Use unused EC2 capacity at a discount of up to 90%, but they can be terminated if AWS needs the capacity back.
Dedicated Hosts: Physical EC2 servers dedicated to your use, ideal for meeting compliance requirements.

5. What are Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and its benefits?
Answer: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps automatically scale your EC2 instances based on demand. It ensures that you have the right number of instances available to handle the load. Benefits include:
Automatic scaling of capacity up or down.
Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
Cost optimization by scaling down when demand is low.

6. What is an Elastic IP Address in AWS?
Answer: An Elastic IP (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address that you can associate with your EC2 instances. It allows you to mask the failure of an instance by rapidly remapping the address to another instance.

7. What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?
Answer:
Stopping: The instance is stopped, and you are no longer charged for hourly instance usage. The data on attached EBS volumes is retained.
Terminating: The instance is permanently deleted, and all associated resources (like EBS volumes) are deleted unless marked to preserve.

8. What is an EC2 Security Group?
Answer: A Security Group is a virtual firewall that controls the traffic to and from EC2 instances. You can define inbound and outbound rules that control the flow of traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and port ranges.

9. How do you monitor EC2 instances?
Answer: EC2 instances can be monitored using Amazon CloudWatch. It tracks metrics like CPU utilization, disk reads/writes, network traffic, and custom metrics. Alarms can also be set to trigger notifications or automated actions based on thresholds.

10. What is EC2 instance metadata, and how do you access it?
Answer: EC2 instance metadata is data about the instance that is accessible from within the instance itself, such as instance ID, public IP address, or security group. You can retrieve it by using the following command from the instance:
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

11. How do you secure data on an EC2 instance?
Answer: Data can be secured in the following ways:
Use security groups to limit access to instances.
Enable encryption for EBS volumes.
Use IAM roles to grant temporary access to resources.
Implement SSH key pairs for secure access to instances.

12. What are EC2 Placement Groups, and what are the types?
Answer: Placement Groups are logical groupings or clusters of instances within a single Availability Zone. Types include:
Cluster Placement Group: Instances are placed in a low-latency group for high-performance computing.
Spread Placement Group: Instances are spread across distinct hardware to reduce failure impact.
Partition Placement Group: Instances are split into partitions where each partition does not share underlying hardware with others.

13. What is the difference between EBS-backed and Instance Store-backed instances?
Answer:
EBS-backed instances: Root volume is an EBS volume, and data persists after the instance is stopped or restarted.
Instance Store-backed instances: Root volume is based on temporary storage (instance store), and data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.

14. What is the purpose of the EC2 Instance Connect?
Answer: EC2 Instance Connect allows you to securely connect to your instances using the SSH protocol without needing to manage SSH keys. It allows browser-based and command-line connections via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

15. What are the best practices for securing an EC2 instance?
Answer:
Use the principle of least privilege for access control.
Disable root access and use sudo for administrative tasks.
Regularly update and patch the OS.
Use security groups and network ACLs for firewalling.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged users.
Enable CloudTrail for logging API activity.
